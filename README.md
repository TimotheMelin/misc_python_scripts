# misc_python_scripts
Python scripts written during gradschool and not updated since then


# How to use the codes
To use the two python codes to generates inputs files, you need:
    - multiplicty.xlsx
    - Frozen_orbital.xlsx
    - A folder named "geom" with each geometry as .txt file
    - A folder named "basis2" with each basis set as .txt file for molpro only

# Other codes
The other python files are mostly saved function that were usesull during my PhD
